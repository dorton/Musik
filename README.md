### Set the following keys in your config/application.yml

(Set it using `bundle exec figaro install`) (and if that fails, you need to `rbenv rehash`)

```
stripe_api_key:
stripe_publishable_key:
GMAIL_USERNAME_DEV:
GMAIL_PASSWORD_DEV:
ADMIN_RECIPIENT_EMAIL:
```
MAKE SURE YOUR APPLICATION YML NEVER EVER EVER GETS PUSHED TO GIT HUB. BAHLEET IT AFTER YOU SET THESE.
